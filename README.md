# Mastermind

## Project info 

A command line Mastermind game played against AI. The purpose of this project was to practice Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

Project description can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind).


## Game info

When the game starts, the player may choose to play as the "code setter" or "code breaker". The "code setter" creates a 4 peg code from 6 different color pegs that form that the "code breaker" tries to solve within 12 guesses. After each guess, the "code breaker" receives feedback on the number of pegs that were the correct color and if correct color pegs are also in the correct spot. For this game, I have assigned numbers 1-6 to the colored pegs, so the user only needs to input those numbers to enter or guess the code.
